# 🌏 My Cool Site Builder

Steal this site and make it cooler.

### Setup

You may need to setup Github Pages. It's easier than it looks and you'll get a free website. First sign up to <a href="https://github.com/join">Github</a> then follow this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">Github Pages Quickstart</a>. You'll need about 15-20 minutes.

### How to blog

Add entries to your "blog" by running the following command from your terminal:

```
node blog.js "I'm a human."
```

The command adds the blog to your index.html then does a git push. You might need Github, see Setup.

### Local development

Just pop the index.html into your browser. 

### Deployment

Run `node blog.js` for a git add, commit and push.
