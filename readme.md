# 🌏 Human vs Web 🤖

Steal this site builder and make it your own. Show the web you're a human and not a robot.

### Setup instructions

Add entries to your "blog" by running the following command from your terminal:

```
node blogger.js "I'm human, I swear"
```

That command adds the entry and does a git push to master. 

You may need to setup Github Pages. 

It's easier than it looks and you'll get a free website. 

✌️
